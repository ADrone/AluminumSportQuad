Overall design methodology will be based on three key things, but won't forget the details! 
Trying to get multicopter design that is the best of 3 issues.  
-mass manufacturable (Lowers Cost!)
-STRONG and capable  (Lowers Repairs)
-lightwieght         (Lowers power use)

Hopefully these requirements donâ€™t change but they are open to discussion.

The idea is to make an INDUSTRIAL frame that can take a beating. 
It has to be able to be made by a maker. 
It sounds obvious but some of the ones out there are almost impossible to make. 
An X is easy but can be prone to more flexing than others, but gives it excellent manufacturability and weight.
Coaxial 8-rotor allows it to save space and have emergency stability.
Have the rotors generally higher than the rest of the platform so that it can easily carry awkward things.



needed - 


-Contributors in any shape and form. It is a fresh project and needs any people.

-attachments and modular ideas.
-Type of modular connector(s) that can be installed and detached quickly.
Go pro, telemetry(ies), fpv stuff, gps(s), antennas, cargo,

-Need to do as many tests as possible and make sure they are repeatable.
-Keep designing and testing new designs.
